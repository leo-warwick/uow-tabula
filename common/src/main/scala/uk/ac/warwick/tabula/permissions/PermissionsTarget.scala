/**
  * Applying this trait to an object signifies that it fulfils a contract for
  * being a target for permissions checking. Roles can grant permissions against
  * objects of this type, or a parent of this object.
  *
  * For example, Assignment may extend PermissionsTarget. A role may grant the
  * permission Assignment.Delete() either directly to the Assignment, or to the
  * module in which the Assignment contains. Permissions checking code can therefore
  * check against the Assignment itself, or (iteratively) against its permissions
  * container.
  *
  * If this object is at the top of its permissions tree (for example, a Department)
  * then permissionsParents should return an empty Seq().

    * exists in multiple departments) where it will return more than one.
