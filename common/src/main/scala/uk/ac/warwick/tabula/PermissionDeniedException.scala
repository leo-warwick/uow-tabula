  * a more specific explanation page for certain situations).
  *
  * It shouldn't generally be possible to get this exception by
  * clicking in the UI. You'd only get this by trying to manually
  * go to a different department's URL, for example, or using a
  * bookmarked link to a department who you've since been removed from.
  *
  * Is a RuntimeException because we don't expect the app to need
  * to declare that this is thrown.
