/**
  * A Promise is effectively a synchronous version of a Future. What
  * you're effectively saying to the code that you pass the Promise to is that
  * you agree to the contract that by the time the other code wants to use it,
  * the Promise will have been fulfilled.
  * <p>
  * An example of this is where you have a command to create a forum topic. This
  * might, internally, use a command to create the initial forum post, which
  * would usually require a topic to already exist. By passing the Promise of a
  * topic instead, you guarantee that by the time the post creation command gets
  * around to creating the post, the Promise of a topic will have been fulfilled.
  * <p>
  * In effect, any producer is itself a promise of the thing that it's producing.
  * The create post command is, effectively, a promise of a Post.
