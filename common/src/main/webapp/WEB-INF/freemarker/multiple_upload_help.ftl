Your browser doesn't seem able to handle uploading multiple files
<noscript>
  (or it does, but your browser is not running the Javascript needed to support it)
</noscript>.
A recent browser like Google Chrome or Firefox will be able to upload multiple files.
You can still upload a single file here if you want.
<div id="multifile-column-description-enabled" class="help-block" style="display:none">
  You can upload multiple files at once. They need to be in the same folder on your computer for you to be able to select them all.
  To select multiple files at once hold down the Ctrl key and click on each file.
</div>

<script nonce="${nonce()}">
  if (window.Supports.multipleFiles) {
    jQuery('#multifile-column').find('h3').html('Select files');
    jQuery('#multifile-column-description').html(jQuery('#multifile-column-description-enabled').html());
  }
</script>
