membership based on changes in SITS.

Soon SITS will be updated for the next academic year (${academicYear.next.toString}). This means that the students in each of these schemes could change in ways that you did not intend.

For example, if a scheme is set to only include students in their first year of study, soon this scheme's membership will become empty - as all current first-year students have their enrolment records updated (and they become second-year students).

To prevent these unwanted changes, we have disabled the link to SITS for all of these schemes. So, these schemes will remain as they are – with their current sets of students – unless you manually make changes.

Follow the links below to view the students on each scheme and make changes where necessary:
