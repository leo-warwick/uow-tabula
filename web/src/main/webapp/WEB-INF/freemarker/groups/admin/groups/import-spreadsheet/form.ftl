  <p>You can create and edit sets of small groups, their groups and events by uploading a spreadsheet.
    Note that the spreadsheet must be in the correct format, for this reason we suggest you
    <a href="<@routes.groups.import_spreadsheet_template department academicYear />">download a template spreadsheet</a> that contains all the current groups
    for this year, and use that
    to create your spreadsheet.</p>

  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>You can add extra sheets to the template and upload it, but you must upload a
      spreadsheet with three sheets: "Sets", "Groups" and "Events" in the same format as the template, and
      they must include the columns in the template (though you can add extra columns if you want, they'll be ignored).</p>
