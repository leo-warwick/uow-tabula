Commands
========

A Command is a parameterised, reusable action that (optionally) takes bound values from the request or elsewhere
and performs an action to give a result. These work best when constructed using the [Cake pattern](Cake.md) and
combining several components together, so this documentation will exclusively use that method, based off
`ComposableCommand`.

When using the cake pattern, declare types up-front on the companion object as they're often shared
with the controller, e.g.

```scala
object MyCommand {
  type ResultType = Bag[Money]
  
  // Declare the various opt-in behaviour of the Command up-front to ensure that a mix-in isn't missed
  type CommandType =
    Appliable[ResultType]
      with MyCommandState
      with MyCommandRequest                               // Binds data from the request
      with PopulateOnForm                                 // Populates defaults when the form is first rendered
      with SelfValidating                                 // Validates data
      with BindListener                                   // Runs pre-binding behaviour
      with Notifies[ResultType, Department]               // Runs notifications based on the result for the department
      with SchedulesNotifications[ResultType, Department] // Schedules notifications based on the result for the department
      with CompletesNotifications[Department]             // Completes notifications on the department
      with GeneratesTriggers[Department]                  // Generates triggers for the department
      
  val RequiredPermission: Permission = Permissions.Department.Finance
      
  // Pass in any required state here
  def apply(department: Department): CommandType =
    new MyCommandInternal(department)
      with ComposableCommand[ResultType]
      with ... // must fit CommandType 
}
```

The contract of `ComposableCommand` specifies that, as a minimum, a Command **MUST**:

* Have an `applyInternal()` method returning the result of the Command
* [Perform permissions checking](#permissions-checking) or be marked as `PubliclyVisiblePermissions`
* [Describe the operation for audit logging](#audit-logging-describable) or be marked as `Unaudited`

Applying
--------

The main body of what a Command does is in its `apply()` method. With the cake pattern, the applying component
is implemented by a class that extends `CommandInternal[A]`, returning an `A` from an `applyInternal()` method.
Typically, you'll want this to perform some database operation so normally your `applyInternal` implementation
will wrap a body in `transactional() {}`, available with `import uk.ac.warwick.tabula.data.Transactions._`.

If your Command is a [read-only command](#read-only-commands) then use `transactional(readOnly = true) {}`.

The flow of `Command.apply()` is as follows:

1. If maintenance mode is enabled, check that the Command has the `ReadOnly` trait. Otherwise, halt execution and
   show an error message
2. Record a `before` [event](#audit-logging-describable) unless the Command is `Unaudited`
3. Run `applyInternal()` and get the result of the Command execution
4. Log any [benchmarking](#benchmarking-execution-time) for the Command execution
5. Push any [notifications generated by the command](#sending-notifications-when-a-command-runs)
6. [Schedule future notifications](#scheduling-notifications-for-the-future) generated by the command
7. Mark any [notifications that the command completes](#completing-notifications) as complete
8. Save any [triggers that the command generates](#triggers)
9. Record an `after` [event](#audit-logging-describable) unless the Command is `Unaudited`
10. Return the result to the caller (typically a Controller or another Command)

Permissions checking
--------------------

Permissions checking is performed at bind-time, so the Command must be available as a
`@ModelAttribute` and included in the method signature of the handler method on the
controller.

Declare the required permissions by mixing in the `RequiresPermissionsChecking` trait. It's
often handy to also include `PermissionsCheckingMethods` which provides `mandatory()` (for example),
though it's the responsibility of the Controller to ensure that `mandatory()` and `mustBeLinked()`
have been called as appropriate on any state that's passed to the command.

```scala
trait MyCommandPermissions extends RequiresPermissionsChecking with PermissionsCheckingMethods {
  self: MyCommandState =>

  override def permissionsCheck(p: PermissionsChecking): Unit = {
    // RequiredPermission would typically be a val declared on the Command's companion object
    // to be explicit, e.g. val RequiredPermission = Permissions.Department.Finance
    p.PermissionCheck(RequiredPermission, mandatory(department))
  }
}
```

Binding data from the request
-----------------------------

Any parameter in a request-mapped Controller method that is annotated with `@ModelAttribute` is 
eligible for binding data from the request. This handles primitive types fine and *Java* collections 
such as a `java.util.List` or an `Array`.

Typically you'd declare the binding parameters as part of a mixed in trait that you then pass into
your command, e.g.:

```scala
object MyCommand {
  def apply() =
    new MyCommandInternal()
      with ComposableCommand[Result]
      with MyCommandRequest
      with ... 
}

abstract class MyCommandInternal() extends CommandInternal[Result] {
  self: MyCommandRequest =>

  override def applyInternal(): Result = ...  
}

trait MyCommandRequest {
  var checkbox: Boolean = _
  var textbox: String = _
  var date: LocalDate = _
}
```

Populating defaults in the request data
---------------------------------------

There are two ways to set defaults in the request data. For simple defaults that will be overridden
when request data is passed, it can just be set in the trait - for example, you might want to make
sure a checkbox is checked by default or that the date defaults to the current date:

```scala
trait MyCommandRequest {
  var checkbox: Boolean = true
  var textbox: String = "Some default value"
  var date: LocalDate = LocalDate.now()
}
```

For expensive operations, there's a commonly used pattern to use a `PopulateOnForm` trait which
is designed to only be called when the form is first rendered, so it doesn't have to be re-calculated
every time. **Note** there is no magic here, the Controller is responsible for calling `.populate()`
at the appropriate time. For example:

```scala
trait MyCommandRequest {
  var expensiveValue: Int = _
}

trait MyCommandPopulate extends PopulateOnForm {
  self: MyCommandRequest =>
  
  override def populate(): Unit = new scala.util.Random.nextInt() // such extravagence
}

@Controller
@RequestMapping(Array("/admin/int"))
class MyController extends BaseController {

  @ModelAttribute("myCommand")
  def myCommand(): MyCommand.CommandType =
    MyCommand()

  @RequestMapping
  def form(@ModelAttribute("myCommand") command: MyCommand.CommandType): String = {
    // We'd make sure to only call this on initial requests, and not on any POSTs
    command.populate()
    "admin/int"
  }
  
  ...
    
}
```

Running code on bind (pre-validation)
-------------------------------------

You can run pre-validation code on bind by mixing in the `BindListener` trait. This is particularly
useful for if you're working with uploaded files, which require `.onBind()` themselves to be called.
You **don't** need to call this yourself from the controller.

```scala
trait MyCommandRequest {
  var file: UploadedFile = new UploadedFile
}

trait MyCommandBinding extends BindListener {
  self: MyCommandRequest =>
  
  override def onBind(result: BindingResult): Unit = transactional() {
    result.pushNestedPath("file")
    file.onBind(result)
    result.popNestedPath()
  }
}
```

Because the BindListener trait is mixed in directly to the command to provide the `onBind` definition, only one bind listener can be registered per command.

Validating data
---------------

In short:

- Always add the `@Valid` annotation to the controller method argument.
- Use validation annotations on your commands for simple things if you want.
- For custom code, make the command extend `SelfValidating` and in the controller body do `validatesSelf[DeleteFeedbackCommand]`

Fuller example (this shows some validation being done twice, you wouldn't use both annotations AND then check it in SelfValidating):

```scala
trait MyCommandRequest {
  @AssertTrue
  var checkbox: Boolean = _
  
  @SafeHtml
  @Length(max = 4000)
  var textbox: String = _
  
  @NotNull
  @Future
  var date: LocalDate = _
}

trait MyCommandValidation extends SelfValidating {
  self: MyCommandRequest =>

  override def validate(errors: Errors): Unit = {
    // The second argument here looks up the message from common/src/main/resources/messages.properties 
    if (!checkbox) 
      errors.rejectValue("checkbox", "errors.checkbox.notChecked")
      
    // Passing arguments allows them to be used in the message, e.g. {0} will be replaced with 4000 here
    if (textbox.length > 4000)
      errors.rejectValue("textbox", "errors.textbox.tooLong", Array(4000), "Too many letterwords")
      
    if (date != null && date.isBeforeNow()) 
      errors.rejectValue("date", "errors.date.tooEarly") 
  }
}
```

Audit logging (Describable)
---------------------------

As part of the Command contract, it must extend `Describable` or `Unaudited` explicitly. Commands
would typically only be `Unaudited` if they perform no action, e.g. a search. The best way to do
this is to mix-in a `Describable` trait based off any state that the command has, optionally adding
request information and also optionally implementing `describeResult` to augment that with additional
information with the result of the operation.

Example:

```scala
trait MyCommandDescription extends Describable[ResultType] {
  self: MyCommandState with MyCommandRequest =>

  // Set the event name explicitly to avoid it being inferred from a compound type
  override lazy val eventName: String = "MyAction"
  
  // Avoid using .property() and .properties() wherever possible to avoid namespace collisions
  // describe() is evaluated after binding, but before anything is applied and is used for the 'before' event
  override def describe(d: Description): Unit =
    d.department(department)
     .property("date" -> date.toString("yyyy-MM-dd"))
  
  // describeResult() is optional data added to the 'after' event once the command has been applied
  override def describeResult(d: Description, result: ResultType): Unit =
    d.property("moneyRobbed", result.size)
}
```

Read-only commands
------------------

By default a Command is writeable which means that when Tabula is in read-only mode, it will prevent
`apply()` being called (because it's expecting to throw an exception). If a Command doesn't perform
any database writes it can mix in the `ReadOnly` trait, this also has performance benefits (i.e.
it runs with a read-only database transaction rather than a writeable one which tracks changes).

Notifications
-------------

If your command should notify users that the operation has happened, you can mix in the `Notifies`
or `SchedulesNotifications` traits to either generate them immediately or in the future. If the
notifications have an action to be completed and your command completes that action, you can also
mix in `CompletesNotifications` to declare which notifications should be marked as completed (these
are displayed differently in the activity stream).

### Sending notifications when a command runs

These notifications are generated immediately and are then processed through the notification listeners
(e.g. to send emails, be sent to My Warwick, etc.)

```scala
trait MyCommandNotifications extends Notifies[ResultType, Department] {
  self: MyCommandState => // Assuming we've got currentUser from here with the person performing the action
  
  override def emit(result: ResultType): Seq[Notification[ResultType, Department]] =
    Seq(
      Notification.init(new MyActionStudentsNotification, currentUser, department),
      Notification.init(new MyActionTutorsNotification, currentUser, department)
    )
}
```

### Scheduling notifications for the future

These notifications are scheduled for a point in the future. The target for the `ScheduledNotification`s
is important here (in this example, `Department`) because every time this is run, any _existing_
`ScheduledNotification`s for the same target are removed (to avoid them stacking).

```scala
trait MyCommandScheduledNotifications extends SchedulesNotifications[ResultType, Department] {
  // Transform the result of the Command to a Seq of all the targets that this will schedule notifications for
  override def transformResult(result: ResultType): Seq[Department] = result.flatMap(_.department)

  // In this example, 12 scheduled notifications are generated as a "Reminder", based on the current
  // date for 12 weeks  
  override def scheduledNotifications(department: Department): Seq[ScheduledNotification[Department]] =
    (1 to 12)
      .map(week => DateTime.now.plusDays(week * 7))
      .map(when => new ScheduledNotification[Department]("MyActionReminder", department, when))
}
```

### Completing notifications

```scala
trait MyCommandNotificationCompletion extends CompletesNotifications[ResultType] {
  self: NotificationHandling =>
  
  // Rather than adding a self-type of MyCommandState as we do above, we just declare the contract
  // explicitly that we must have the currentUser defined
  def currentUser: User

  override def notificationsToComplete(result: ResultType): CompletesNotificationsResult = {
    if (result.nonEmpty) {
      CompletesNotificationsResult(
        notificationService.findActionRequiredNotificationsByEntityAndType[MyActionStudentsNotification](department) ++
        notificationService.findActionRequiredNotificationsByEntityAndType[MyActionTutorsNotification](department),
        currentUser
      )
    } else {
      EmptyCompletesNotificationsResult
    }
  }
}
```

Triggers
--------

A Trigger is any operation that can be scheduled to run in the future based on the result of a
Command's execution. For example, any Command that modifies an Assignment's deadline would generate
an `AssignmentClosedTrigger` for the deadline date-time, to do things like release submissions to markers
or send them off to Turnitin. The target for the `Trigger`s is important here (in the example below, `Department`)
because every time this is run, any _existing_ `Trigger`s for the same target are removed (to avoid them stacking).

```scala
trait MyCommandTriggers extends GeneratesTriggers[ResultType] {
  self: MyCommandState with MyCommandRequest =>  

  override def generateTriggers(result: ResultType): Seq[Trigger[_ >: Null <: ToEntityReference, _]] =
    Seq(DatePassedTrigger(date.withTimeAtStartOfDay(), department))
}
```

Benchmarking execution time
---------------------------

As Commands are quite commonly where the most intensive database or CPU-driven work takes place, it's a good
place to place benchmarking to diagnose performance at a later date. Every Command is benchmarked in its own
right and if it exceeds a benchmark (`Command.MillisToSlowlog`) is automatically logged. You can break this
down further by mixing in `TaskBenchmarking` and wrapping individual tasks with `benchmarkTask()`. e.g.

```scala
abstract class MyCommandInternal() extends CommandInternal[ResultType] with TaskBenchmarking {
  override def applyInternal(): ResultType = {
    val expensive1 = benchmarkTask("Calculate expensive1") {
      ...
    }

    val expensive2 = benchmarkTask("Calculate expensive2") {
      ...
    }

    ...
  }
}
```

These calls can be nested and will be broken down as such in the logging.
